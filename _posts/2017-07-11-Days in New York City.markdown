When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the vocational bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of New York City, the seperate and equal to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent amount of respect to the needs of interns requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to have fun.

If you're wondering why the previous sentence sounds familiar, congratulations, you remembered the first parts of the Declaration of Independence, and should be proud that you at least have some knowledge of one of the greatest documents humankind has produced. If not, well, go read <a href= "http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">it</a>! 

Anyways, it's been a few weeks since my previous blog post, and I want to share with you guys the perks of interning in NYC. Every weekend, a group of friends interning at IBM Research go to the bustling city of New York City, and explore its long avenues and streets in pursuit of food and fun. Needless to say, we ran into some very nice graffitis, pretty buildings and a very old ATM. Here, take a look!

As the pictures show, you've got a bunch of interns at IBM Research with nothing else better to do but wonder in New York City. To be honest, that's not such a bad thing! <span class="evidence">I think sometimes people should drift around in places such as NYC with no prior plans, because it makes your explorations even more fun!</span>
