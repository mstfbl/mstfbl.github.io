This is the motto I have chosen for myself. Translated from Latin, it means, "Knowledge is my light," but it could also mean "Cognition is my light." 

For those who might be familiar with the mottos of famous universities, this motto shares a lot with the University of Oxford's "Dominus illuminatio mea," which means "The Lord is my light."

The reason why I chose this as my personal motto lies in the way I perceive, think, and act in the world. I rely on the knowledge I have, the senses I've tuned, and the thought process I've fed and bred over the course of my life to make decisions for both the short term and the long term.

And why is it Latin? Well, I do enjoy the classics, and looking at terms we hear everyday such as "Veritas" or "Veni, vidi, vici," I thought it would only be fitting if I chose one in Latin as well...
