Hi there! I'm Mustafa Bal. I'm currently working on something new! I was previously at <a href="http://snowflake.com">Snowflake</a> as a machine learning engineer, where I optimized the company's <a href="https://medium.com/snowflake/efficiency-at-snowflake-free-pool-management-9dd7a0bd34d1">compute demand prediction</a>. Before that, I was at <a href="microsoft">Microsoft</a> as a software engineer, where I worked on <a href="http://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a>, <a href="http://onnxruntime.ai">ONNX Runtime</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet">ML.NET</a>.

I graduated from <a href= "http://harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> on May 2019 with a joint bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Linguistics. I served as a Teaching Fellow for <a href= "https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs152/2019sp/">CS 152</a> with <a href= "https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Professor Stephen Chong</a>, and taught for <a href= "https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/">CS 50</a> with <a href= "https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/">Professor David Malan</a> in Fall 2017.

I grew up in Ankara, Turkey and McLean, VA, where I graduated from <a href= "http://tjhsst.fcps.edu"> Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> in June 2015. Outside of academics, my hobbies include snowboarding, chasing sunny day drives, and going on endless walks. I'm also interested in learning & discussing about international politics and philosophy.
