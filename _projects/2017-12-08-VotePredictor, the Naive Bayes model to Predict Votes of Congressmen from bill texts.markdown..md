VotePredictor is a Naive Bayes Model written in Python 3.6 to predict votes of current Congressmen in the United States Congress on bills based on the text of the said bills. The dependencies that were used in this project are <a href="http://www.nltk.org/install.html">nltk</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html">matplotlib</a>.

This project was made for my CS 182: Aritificial Intelligence class final project. The link to the GitHub repo is <a href="https://github.com/mstfbl/VotePredictor">here</a>.
